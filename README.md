Resume Ranker is a smart, AI-powered web application designed to help recruiters and HR professionals automatically evaluate and rank job applicants' resumes based on a given job description. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract, analyze, and compare key skills, qualifications, and experiences from resumes against the job requirements. Users can upload multiple resumes and input a job description, and the application returns a relevance score for each candidate along with insights into skill matches and gaps.

This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with web development, combining Python (Flask), NLP libraries, and a user-friendly front-end built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Key Features:

Resume upload and text extraction (PDF/DOC support)
